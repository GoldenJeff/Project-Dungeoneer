# Creating Your Character

In project dungeoneer, you create your character through two systems:

- Rolling stats   
- Choosing equipment 

When you open the game, you will be presented with the character creator. It will give you the options necessary to create your character. You determine your stats by pressing the “Roll Stats” button. By doing so you roll a fresh new set of stats that influence your character. 

- Strength(Str) represents your character’s fortitude and vitality, in addition to their prowess with the average weapon. This stat influences your Health Points(Hp) and the damage of your weapon attacks with non-finesse weapons and finesse weapons if your Strength is higher than your Dexterity  
- Dexterity(Dex) Represents your character’s handiness and deftness, in addition to increased damage with weapons you can move around with. This stat influences your Action Points(Ap) and the damage of weapon attacks with finesse-class weapons.   
- Willpower(Wil) represents your character’s intelligence, and mental fortitude as well as your magical abilities. This stat influences your Magic Points(Mp) and damage with spells. 

Once you have determined your stats, be they good or bad, you must choose your starting equipment, or leave it up to the hand of fate(Pressing the “Reroll Equipment” button). There are different classifications for the weapons, armor and spells. 

- Bulky weapons require more agility to wield, therefore costing double the amount of their non-hefty counterparts  
- Finesse weapons are special because they pair well with dexterity. They may not hit hard, but they can attack more.  
- Bulky armor impairs your ability to use spells, causing them to \[Redacted\] 

Once you know what you’re choosing, it’s time to choose your equipment. Here’s a handy guide on the nomenclature with equipment:

- 1d6. This means that the weapon or spell will do anywhere from 1-6 damage, plus any relevant modifiers.  
- Armor. This reduces the damage that enemies deal to you by the value. The most armor you can have is 3\.
